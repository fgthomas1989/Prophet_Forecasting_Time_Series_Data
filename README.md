___
For this project, I play the role of a MercadoLibre analyst tasked with predicting search traffic can also lead to the ability to trade the stock.

As such, I created forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb, containing my data preparation, analysis, and visualizations with some time series data. Specifically, the notebook includes the following:

* Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

* An evaluation of how the companyâ€™s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

* A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

* Some findings
